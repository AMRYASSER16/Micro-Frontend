# Microfrontend Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Microfrontend Learning Repository**! This repo is dedicated to exploring and implementing different microfrontend architectures and techniques. Each folder represents a unique microfrontend project with its own setup, technologies, and documentation.

## Introduction
This repository is a hands-on approach to understanding microfrontendsâ€”techniques for breaking down frontend monoliths into smaller, independent pieces, each managed by its own team and built using possibly different technologies. Microfrontends can improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility in large web applications.

## What are Microfrontends?
Microfrontends are an architectural pattern where a web application is decomposed into smaller, self-contained frontend applications, which can be built, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microfrontend can be developed by different teams, using different technologies if needed, and integrated to work as a cohesive user experience.

## Projects Overview
This repository includes various projects, each demonstrating a different microfrontend approach:

1. **Basic Microfrontend** - A simple example with minimal configuration.
2. **Module Federation with Webpack** - Uses Webpack's Module Federation for sharing code and resources.
3. **Single-SPA Integration** - Implements microfrontends with [Single-SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/).
4. **Microfrontends with iframes** - Uses iframes as a lightweight integration technique.
5. **Custom Framework Integration** - A project exploring microfrontends with custom frameworks.

Each project will include its own README with setup instructions and key learnings.
